# stockbase
## Overview
**stockbase** is an "in-development" asset management system being designed to be adaptive and easy to use.  It is being designed to track IT assets such as laptops, desktops, and software.
## How it will work
**stockbase** will relay on a front end server in conjunction with a back end server that is interacted with via a secure REST API.  This API will be designed to allow for other integrations beyond the web interface.
## Framework
This application is using the React framework for the front end as well as NodeJS for both the API and front end.
